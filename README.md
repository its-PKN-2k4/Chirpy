# Project: Chirpy Webserver

This is a guided project course from [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/). Chirpy is a social media platform that allows people to publish short messages (140 characters or fewer) called "chirps" (definitely not a rip-off of Twitter/X :D). The end result of this project is a simulated webserver for Chirpy that can handle basic CRUD operations.
